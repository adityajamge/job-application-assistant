## 🎓 Example Good Answer

**Question:** "Tell me about a challenging project you worked on."

**Good Answer:**
"In my previous role at Tech Corp, I led the development of a real-time analytics dashboard that was experiencing severe performance issues. The dashboard was taking over 30 seconds to load, causing user frustration. I analyzed the codebase and identified that we were making redundant API calls and not implementing proper caching. I refactored the data fetching logic using React Query, implemented Redis caching on the backend, and optimized our database queries. As a result, we reduced load time to under 2 seconds, a 93% improvement, and user engagement increased by 40%. This project taught me the importance of performance monitoring and proactive optimization."

**Why it's good:**
- ✅ Specific situation and metrics
- ✅ Clear problem statement
- ✅ Detailed technical solution
- ✅ Quantifiable results
- ✅ Lesson learned
